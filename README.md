### A set of modular scripts to setup a machine for utrumque work

Go to the `utruscripts` folder and start with running your **personal setup script**. This script starts with `apt update` and `apt upgrade`.

`
sh setup-ludvig.sh
`

or

`
sh setup-gerhard.sh
`

Then run the following scripts in this order:

```
sh setup-audio-tools.sh
sh setup-supercollider-devel.sh
sh setup-reaper.sh
sh setup-mcfx-plugins.sh
sh setup-ssh.sh
sh setup-vnc.sh
sh setup-dropbox.sh
```

The last four scripts need further attention/interaction by/from the user.

Run the following script as the last one, since a **reboot** is required afterwards:

```
sh setup-audio.sh
reboot
```

After the reboot run this script to **check** if your audio configuration is OK:

`
sh check-audio-setup.sh
`
